# newAlacrittySameCDW
A shell script to open a new alacritty terminal in the working directory of the active one (on hyprland).<br>
if you are not using hyprland, you can still change "ACTIVE_PID" to whatever command can returns you you're active window PID.<br><br>

I made this out of a personnal need.<br>
this script is meant to be triggered by a keybind.<br>

# Download

and ramplace you're keybind to run alacritty by the script path.<br>
