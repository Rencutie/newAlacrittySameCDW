# newAlacrittySameCDW
A shell script to open a new alacritty terminal in the working directory of the active one (on hyprland). 
if you are not using hyprland, you can still change "ACTIVE_PID" to whatever command can returns you you're active window PID.

I made this out of a personnal need.
this script is meant to be triggered by a keybind.

# Download
copy past into some place
name it as you wish
chmod +x [itsName]
and ramplace you're keybind to run alacritty by the script path.
